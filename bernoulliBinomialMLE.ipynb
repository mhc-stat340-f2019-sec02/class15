    "We'll need a bit of background.\n",
    "Logistic regression attempts to predict a binary variable and so we'll need to understand distributions related to binary variables.\n",
    "To find the optimal coefficients, we'll maximize a function called the likelihood.\n",
    "The below summarized distributions of binary variables, the maximum likelihood approach in general, and as it relates to logistic regression (linear regression is included as an aside).\n",
