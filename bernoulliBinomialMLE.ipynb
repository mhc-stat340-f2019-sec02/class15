    "\n",
    "Our goal for this class is to understand how to compute the optimal beta coefficients for logistic regression.\n",
    "We'll need a bit of background.\n",
    "Logistic regression attempts to predict a binary variable and so we'll need to understand distributions related to binary variables.\n",
    "To find the optimal coefficients, we'll maximize a function called the likelihood.\n",
    "The below summarized distributions of binary variables, the maximum likelihood approach in general, and as it relates to logistic regression (linear regression is included as an aside).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bernoulli distributed random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A random variable $X$ is Bernoulli distributed is can take two values: zero and one.\n",
    "The variable $X$ equals $1$ with probability $p$ and $X$ equals $0$ with probability $1-p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected value---the average over all values the random variable can take weighted by their corresponding probabilities---equals $p$.\n",

    "The variance---or average squared difference around the expected value---equals $p(1-p)$.\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\text{Var}(X) &= E(X-\\mu)^2 = E(X-p)^2 = p \\times (1-p)^2 + (1-p)\\times (0-p)^2\\\\ \n",

    "The data we study with logistic regression can be viewed as a stream of $1$s and $0$s together with covariate data.\n",
    "If we assume our data is generated by a Bernoulli-distributed variable, then the goal is to estimate $p$ (the only parameter) and how covariate information changes $p$. \n",

    "##  Maximum likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "A model assigns a probability to possible events we may see in our data and can depend on a set of parameters.\n",

    "For example, a linear regression *model* assumes individual $y$ values are normally distributed with constant variance\n",
